# ONS Record Linkage Pipeline Example Scripts
A set of Python scripts to demonstrate deterministic and probabilistic data linkage, using synthetic  census and post-enumeration survey (PES) data.

For additional information consider reading:

## Directories and files of note

Descriptions of project directories and other significant files:
* `Data/` - the required mock data to operate the scripts at a basic level
* `lib/` - contains helper functions and configurable parameters
* `pipeline/` - scripts forming the example record linkage pipeline
* `setup/` - required packages and versions with instructions on terminal installation via `pip` 
* `training/` - code to demonstrate key data linkage operations including expectation maximisation
