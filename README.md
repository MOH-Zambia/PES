# Rwandan_linkage

A set of Python scripts to demonstrate deterministic and probabilistic linkage, using synthetic data

To run this interatively, follow this link:

## Project structure
* All related data for the project is found within `Data/`
* `m_u_values.py` calculates m and u probabilities needed for probabilistic matching. This will need to be ran ahead of running `Probabilistic_matching.py`
